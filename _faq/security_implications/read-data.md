Forseti uses a service account that is granted roles on the organization's
Cloud IAM policy. Because GCP roles are hierarchical, when someone has
a Cloud IAM role at the organization level, child resources like folders and
projects inherit the role. For example, if you grant the "Browser" role
to someone at the organization level, they will also be able to see folders and
projects within the organization.

[Service account for Forseti Security]({% link _docs/latest/concepts/service-accounts.md %}).
