title: Why does Forseti store the G Suite private key in the Compute Engine instance?

{::options auto_ids="false" /}

The 
[Admin API](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation), 
which performs the G Suite Groups data retrieval, uses methods from an OAuth library 
which expect the private key to be local to where the code is running. 
To minimize G Suite service account access, don't assign any Cloud IAM roles to it 
and only grant the Groups/Group Members Read-Only scope in G Suite.

[Forseti Service Accounts]({% link _docs/latest/concepts/forseti-service-accounts.md %}#g-suite-groups-service-account) page.
