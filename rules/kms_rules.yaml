# Rule Keys:
# name: The unique name describing the rule
# mode: Depending on whether you want to allow or block in a given situation,
# mode can be whitelist or blacklist
# resource: A mapping of resources that this rule applies to.
#  * type: The type of resource, can be organization, folder, or project.
#  * resource_ids: A list of one or more numeric ids to match, or '*' for all.
# key: The configuration of cryptokey that this rule applies to.
#  * name: The unique name describing the cryptographic key. '*' is also
# supported to capture all the keys in a organization/folder/project.
#  * state: Denotes the state of a key version. Optional, if not included
# state is not compared.
#  * protection_level: Indicates whether cryptographic operations are performed
# in software or in Hardware Security Module (HSM). Optional, if not provided
# protection_level is not
# compared.
#  * algorithm: Denotes the algorithm of that key. Optional, if not provided
# algorithm is not compared.
#  * purpose: Defines the cryptographic abilities of the key. Optional, if not
# provided purpose is not compared.
#  * rotation_range: Denotes the range of the nextRotationTime of multiple keys
# in a project. Optional, if not provided nextRotationTime of cryptographic keys
# is not compared.
#  * rotation_period: Denotes the time period to rotate a key. Optional, if
# not provided rotation_range is not compared.
#  * labels: Allows you to group your keys. Optional, if not provided labels are
# not compared.
