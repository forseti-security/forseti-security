# Forseti Rules
This directory is used as local storage by Forseti for the scanner rules. The 
[default rules](https://forsetisecurity.org/docs/latest/configure/scanner/default-rules.html) will be copied into this 
directory by the Forseti GCE VM. Forseti on GKE defaults to GCS for scanner rules storage.
