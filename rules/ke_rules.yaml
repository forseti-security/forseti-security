# Rule Keys:
# name: The unique name describing the rule
# resource: A mapping of resources that this rule applies to.
#  * type: The type of resource, can be organization, folder, or project.
#  * resource_ids: A list of one or more numeric ids to match, or '*' for all.
# check_serverconfig_valid_node_versions: If true, will raise a violation for
#    any node pool running a version that is not listed as supported for the'
#    zone the cluster is running in.
# check_serverconfig_valid_master_versions: If true, will raise a violation for
#    any cluster running an out of date master version. New clusters can only
#    be created with a supported master version.
# allowed_nodepool_versions: Optional, if not included all versions are allowed.
#        The list of rules for what versions are allowed on nodes.
#  * major: The major version that is allowed.
#  * minor: Optional, the minor version that is allowed. If not included, all
#        minor versions are allowed.
#  * operator: Optional, defaults to =, can be one of (=, >, <, >=, <=). The
#        operator determines how the current version compares with the allowed
#        version. If a minor version is not included, the operator applies to
#        major version. Otherwise it applies to minor versions within a single
#        major version.
