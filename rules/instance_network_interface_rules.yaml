#   # This rule helps with:
#   # #1 Ensure instances with external IPs are only running 
#   # on whitelisted networks
#   # #2 Ensure instances are only running on networks created in allowed 
#   # projects (using XPN)
#   - name: all networks covered in whitelist
#     project: '*'
#     network: '*'
#     is_external_network: True
#     # This would be a custom list of your projects/networks.
#     whitelist:
#       project-1:
#        - network-1
#       project-2:
#        - network-2
#        - network-2-2
#       project-3:
