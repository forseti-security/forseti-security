==========

This empty third-party directory provides a marker for the sphinx-doc LICENSE.

We make use of customized Sphinx Jinja templates when generating our Sphinx
documentation. You can find these files under: ./scripts/docker/data/

Futhermore, the files must exist under that directory to be apart of the Docker
context when building.
