# This file contains several example required firewall rules.
# 
# Note: Required and Matches rules can only have "match_policies" fields which will
# be validated.
#
# Required rules are evaluated in the following steps:
# 1. Get list of all pairs of resources and policies that apply to the resource.
# 2. For each pair, get a list of applicable rules by:
#   a. Checking if a rule applies to the specific resource.
#   b. Checking each parent in the hierarchy for a rule that applies to that parent.
#     See: https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy
#   c. Return the first applicable rules.
# 3. For each applicable rule, check if the policy matches one of the "match_policies"
#   defined in the rule. If it does not, then this creates a RuleViolation.

    # This rule will trigger on policies that do not have the required policy.

    # Example triggering firewall rules:

    #   {
    #     "name": "firewall1",
    #     "network": "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/yourproject/global/networks/default",
    #     "priority": 1000,
    #     "sourceRanges": [
    #       "10.0.0.0/8",
    #       ],
    #     "allowed": [
    #       {
    #         "IPProtocol": "all",
    #       }
    #     ],
    #     "direction": "INGRESS",
