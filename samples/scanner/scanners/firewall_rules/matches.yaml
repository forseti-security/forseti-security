# This file contains several example matches firewall rules.
# 
# Note: Required and Matches rules can only have "match_policies" fields which will
# be validated.
#
# Matches rules are evaluated in the following steps:
# 1. Get list of all pairs of resources and policies that apply to the resource.
# 2. For each pair, get a list of applicable rules by:
#   a. Checking if a rule applies to the specific resource.
#   b. Checking each parent in the hierarchy for a rule that applies to that parent.
#     See: https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy
#   c. Return the first applicable rules.
# 3. Check if the policy matches all of the "match_policies" defined in the rule.
#     If it does not, then this creates a RuleViolation.
rules:

    # This rule will trigger on policies that do not match the required policy.
