# This file contains several example whitelist firewall rules.
# 
# Whitelist rules are evaluated in the following steps:
# 1. Get list of all pairs of resources and policies that apply to the resource.
# 2. For each pair, get a list of applicable rules by:
#   a. Checking if a rule applies to the specific resource.
#   b. Checking each parent in the hierarchy for a rule that applies to that parent.
#     See: https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy
#   c. Return the first applicable rules.
# 3. For each applicable rule, check if the policy is a superset of one of the "match_policies" defined in the rule.
# 4. For any rule with a matching policy, check if the policy is a subset of any of the "verify_policies"
#     if not, create a RuleViolation.
