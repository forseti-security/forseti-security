This page describes how to enable the collection of G Suite Google Groups for
processing by Forseti Scanner and Enforcer.

## Enable Domain-Wide Delegation in G Suite

To enable collection of G Suite Google Groups, follow the steps below to create a
service account just for this functionality:

1.  Create a service account to inventory G Suite Google Groups:
    1.  Go to
        [Cloud Platform Console Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
        and click **Create service account**.
    1.  On the **Create service account** dialog that appears, set up your service account:
        1.  Enter a service account name.
        1.  Select the **Enable G Suite Domain-wide Delegation** checkbox.
        1.  Click **Create**.
    1.  To create and download a JSON key for the service account:
        1.  Click **More** on the service account row, then click **Create key**.

        1.  On the **Create private key** dialog that appears, select **JSON**, then click **Create**.
        1.  In the **Save File** window that appears, save the file to a local directory.
    1.  On the service account row, click **View Client ID**.
    1.  On the **Client ID for Service account client** panel that appears,
    copy the **Client ID** value, which will be a large number.

1.  Enable the service account in your G Suite admin control panel. You must have
    the **super admin** role in admin.google.com to complete these steps:
    1.  Go to your Google Admin [Manage API client access](https://admin.google.com/ManageOauthClients)
    Security settings.
    1.  In the **Client Name** box, paste the **Client ID** you copied above.
    1.  In the **One or More API Scopes** box, paste the following scope:
        ```
        https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly
        ```
    1. Click **Authorize**.

## Enabling Forseti's G Suite Google Groups collection

After you create a service account above, edit the following variables in your
version of `forseti_conf.yaml`:

-   `groups-domain-super-admin-email`: Use of the Admin API requires delegation
    (impersonation). Enter an email address of a Super Admin in the GSuite
    account.
-   `groups-service-account-key-file`: Forseti Inventory uses this path to
    locate the key file which you downloaded earlier.

## Deploying to GCP with G Suite Google Groups collection

If you
[created a deployment]({% link _docs/quickstarts/forseti-security/index.md %})
on GCP, run the following command to copy your G Suite key to your Forseti instance:

  ```
  gcloud compute copy-files path/to/service-account-key.json \
      ubuntu@YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME:/home/ubuntu/gsuite_key.json
  ```

Note the remote destination of where you put the key on the VM instance. It
should match what you specified in your forseti_conf.yaml for the
`groups-service-account-key-file` property.
