This guide describes how to set up Explain for Forseti Security.
Explain helps you understand the Cloud Identity and Access Management
(Cloud IAM) policies that affect your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources.
It can enumerate access by resource or member, answer why a principal has access 
to a certain resource, or offer possible strategies for how to grant a specific 
resource.

## Running Explain

Before you start using Explain, you'll first select the data model you
want to use.
