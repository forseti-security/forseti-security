This page describes how Forseti Notifier is used and run.

Notifier can either run as part of the scheduled cron job's workflow
or manually invoked using the Forseti command-line interface (CLI).

When the cron job runs the Notifier, it sends notifications on the
latest violations from the previous Scanner run.
