This guide explains how to use the Forseti installation tool.

## Before you begin

Before you run the setup wizard, you will need:

  - A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) organization for which you want to deploy 
    Forseti.
  - Organization Administrator Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM)
    role so the script can assign the Forseti service account roles on the
		organization Cloud IAM policy.
  - A GCP project dedicated to Forseti. You can reuse the same project that has
    Forseti 1.0 installed in it.
  - Enable billing on the project.


## Setting up Forseti Security

The installer automatically determines setup information, generates a deployment
template, and creates a Forseti deployment.

### Activate Google Cloud Shell

It's best to use
[Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/quickstart) to run the Forseti
installer. This ensures you're using the latest version of Cloud SDK since it's
included in Cloud Shell. To prepare to run the Forseti setup wizard, follow the
steps below:

  1. Go to the [Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
  1. In the **Select a project** drop-down list at the top of the console,
     select the project to which you want to deploy Forseti.
  1. On the top right, click the icon to **Activate Google Cloud Shell**. The
     Cloud Shell panel opens at the bottom of the page.

### Run setup

  1. After you've started Cloud Shell, download Forseti. The installer is
     included. Getting `2.0-dev-rc1` branch will install Forseti v2.0 Release
     Candidate 1.

      ```bash
      git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/forseti-security.git
      ```

  1. Running the installer:

     To install both client and server:
     
     ```bash 
     python setup/installer.py
     ```

      To see additional configurations for the setup:

      ```bash
      python installer.py -h
      ```

  1. The installer will infer the necessary information to install Forseti.

     If you ran the `installer.py` without extra flags, you will be
     prompted to enter the following:

     * SendGrid API key \[Optional\]: Used for sending email via SendGrid. For
       more information, see
       [Enabling email notifications]({% link _docs/latest/configure/email-notification.md %}).
     * Email recipient \[Optional\]: If you provide a SendGrid API key, you will
       also be asked to whom Forseti should send the email notifications.
     * G Suite super admin email \[Not optional\]: This is part of the
       [G Suite Google Groups collection]({% link _docs/latest/configure/gsuite-group-collection.md %})
       and is necessary. Ask your G Suite Admin if you don't know the super
       admin email.

  1. After you install the server, a cron job automatically runs every other hour
     to get the latest configuration file and execute the following commands on
     your Cloud Storage bucket:
     ```bash
       MODEL_ID=$(/bin/date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S)
       forseti inventory create --import_as ${MODEL_ID}
       forseti model use ${MODEL_ID}
       forseti scanner run
       forseti notifier run
     ```

    for processing by Forseti.
