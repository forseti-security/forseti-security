This page explains how to set up Forseti for local development.

## Before you begin

To complete this guide, you will need:

- A GCP organization.
- A GCP project (in above organization) for Forseti Security with billing enabled.
- The ability to assign roles on your organization's Cloud IAM policy.

## Setting GCP infrastructure

### Setting up Cloud SQL

Forseti stores data in Cloud SQL. You can connect to the Cloud SQL instance by
using the Cloud SQL proxy to authenticate to GCP with your Google credentials, 
instead of opening up network access to your Cloud SQL instance.
To set up your Cloud SQL instance for Forseti, follow the steps below:

1.  Go to the [Cloud Console SQL page](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql) and
    follow the steps below to create a new instance:
    1.  Select a **MySQL** database engine.
    1.  Select a **Second Generation** instance type.
    1.  On the **Create a MySQL Second Generation instance** page, enter an
        **Instance ID** and **Root password**, then select the following
        settings:
        1.  **Database version:** MySQL 5.7
        1.  **Machine type:** db-n1-standard-1 machine type
        1.  **Storage capacity:** 25 GB
    1.  Add or modify other database details as you wish.
    1.  When you're finished setting up the database, click **Create**.
1.  [Create a new user](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/create-manage-users#creating),
    e.g. `forseti_user`,
    with [read/write privileges](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/users?hl=en_US#privileges)
    for Forseti to access the database. Don't set a password for the new user.
    This will allow Cloud SQL Proxy to handle authentication to your instance.
1.  [Create a new database](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/create-manage-databases#creating_a_database),
    e.g. `forseti_security`.
1.  Use the [SQL Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql-connect-proxy#connecting_mysql_client)
    to proxy your connection to your Cloud SQL instance. Your
    INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME is the **Instance Connection Name** under
    **Properties** on the Cloud SQL dashboard instance details, with the format "PROJECTID:REGION:INSTANCEID".
    
      ```bash
      $ <path/to/cloud_sql_proxy> -instances=INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME=tcp:3306
      ```
      
1. Make a note of your the Cloud SQL user you created (e.g. "forseti_user") as well as 
   the database name (e.g. "forseti_security" -- this is NOT the ID of your Cloud SQL instance). 
   You will need these for your forseti_conf.yaml later.

## Setting up local environment

### Ubuntu setup

Install the necessary python dev tools using the following command:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev
```

### Mac setup

This guide makes a very light assumption that you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

Use the following command to install python (which will also install the necessary python dev tools):

```bash
$ brew install python
```

Also install openssl:

```bash
$ brew install openssl
```

### Installing mysql_config

The MySql-python library requires the `mysql_config` utility to be present in your system.
Following are example commands to install `mysql_config`:

  ```bash
  # Ubuntu
  # Note: If libmysqlclient-dev doesn't install `mysql_config`, then try also installing `mysql_server`.
  # If you encounter the following error, use command `sudo apt-get install default-libmysqlclient-dev` instead.
  # E: Package 'libmysqlclient-dev' has no installation candidate
  $ sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

  # OSX, using homebrew
  $ brew install mysql
  ```
  
### Installing ssl dev

The crypto libraries require `libssl-dev` and `libffi-dev`.

  ```bash
  # Ubuntu
  $ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libffi-dev
  ```

### Creating a virtualenv

Use the following command to create a virtualenv:

  ```bash
  # create a virtualenv
  $ mkvirtualenv forseti-security
  $ workon forseti-security
  ```

### Getting the source code

Use the command below to get the Forseti code if you haven't already:

  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/forseti-security.git
  ```

### Installing build dependencies

Use the following command to install required build dependencies:

  ```bash
  $ pip install --upgrade \
    coverage \
    codecov \
    google-apputils \
    grpcio==1.4.0 \
    grpcio-tools==1.4.0 \
    mock \
    netaddr \
    parameterized \
    pylint
  ```

### Running the python setup

Use the following commands to navigate to your cloned repo and run the python setup:

  ```bash
  $ cd forseti-security
  $ python setup.py install
  ```

### Troubleshooting

If you are installing on Mac OS X with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and see 
a fatal error related to `'openssl/opensslv.h' file not found`, you may need to 
export `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` for the openssl package
(see [this issue](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/3489) for more information).
You can find the `CPPFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` information and export them as follows:

  ```bash
  $ brew info openssl
  
    ... lots of information ...
    
    Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your
    own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your
    build variables:

    LDFLAGS:  -L/SOME/PATH/TO/openssl/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/SOME/PATH/TO/openssl/include
  ```

Then copy the `LDFLAGS` and `CPPFLAGS` values and export them, similar to the 
following (use the values from your terminal, not "`/SOME/PATH/TO`"):

  ```bash
  $ export CPPFLAGS=-I/SOME/PATH/TO/openssl/include
  $ export LDFLAGS=-L/SOME/PATH/TO/openssl/lib
  ```

### Configuring Forseti settings

Before you run Forseti, you need to edit the forseti_conf.yaml file, found in
`forseti-security/configs/forseti_conf.yaml`. Refer to 
["Configuring Forseti"]({% link _docs/latest/configure/configuring-forseti.md %}) 
for more information.

### Executing Forseti commands

After you complete the above steps, you should be able to run the following
command-line tools:

-   `forseti_inventory`
-   `forseti_scanner`
-   `forseti_enforcer`
-   `forseti_notifier`
-   `forseti_api`
-   `forseti_iam`

To display the flag options for each tool, use the `--helpshort` or `--helpfull`
flags.
