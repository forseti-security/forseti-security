This page describes the branches in the Forseti repository and how they're used
and managed.

## Branches

### Main branches

These are the branches that the Forseti Security project team use
for developing, creating releases, and building the website.

* `dev`: The development branch.
* `master`: The latest stable release; suitable for deploy to production.
* `forsetisecurity.org`: Forseti website.

The `dev` branch is the starting point where you can create a new PR. 
Although there are unit tests, the `dev` branch is still considered to be
unreliable because it can change before it's merged into the `master`
branch.

The `master` branch is checkpointed code from the `dev` branch that
has passed QA and integration testing. The `master` branch is considered
to be stable and suitable for production-use.

### Next-generation branches

Branches will be created to develop the versions of Forseti Security. 
These next-generation branches will be prefixed with a version number.

Typically, the team will begin with an `N.N-dev` branch. After the code
is developed so it's suitable for early testing, an Early Access Phase (EAP)
branch will be created, like `N.N-eap1`.

After the EAP is complete, a Release Candidate (RC) will be created, like
`N.N-rc1`. After all testing requirements are satisfied,
the team will merge the completed code into `N.N-dev`, then into
`N.N-master`, then into `dev`, and finally `master`.

Following is an example of this workflow for version 2.0:

* `2.0-dev`: A daily development branch.
* `2.0-eap1`: A branch used for Early Access testing.
* `2.0-rc1`: A possible release candidate.
* `2.0-rc2`: A second release candidate with additional changes.
* `2.0-master`: The final released version of v2.0.

After the support period has passed for the previous version, the
next-generation `dev` and `master` branches will be merged into the
`dev` and `master` branches. Then, the `N.N-<name>` branches will be deleted. 
This is so that the `dev` and `master` are always maintained as the canonical
branches, and all the commit histories are retained.

### Other branches

Other active branches in the Forseti repo are those created by other developers
to contribute to Forseti. You can generally disregard any branches that aren't
described above.

## Version numbering scheme

Forseti versions are denoted with an `X.Y.Z` version numbering schema.

```
X signifies architectural changes.
Y signifies database schema changes.
Z signifies code changes.
```

The process below outlines how minor new `X.Y.Z` point versions are managed.

1. When a new point version is ready to be released, a new `x.Y.z` or `x.y.Z`
version will be created from the `dev` branch.

1. The release branch will undergo functional and integration testing. Any bugs
found are fixed as follows:

   2. A new feature branch is created from the release branch.
  
   2. A code review is completed.
  
   2. The bug fix is merged back into the release branch.

1. When the release branch is fully qualified, the branch is merged into 
the `master` and `dev` branch.

1. After the release branch is merged, it's deleted.
