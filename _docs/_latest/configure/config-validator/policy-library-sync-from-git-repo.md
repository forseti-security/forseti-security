## **Policy Library Sync from Git Repository**

As part of the Terraform configuration, you will need to include a few 
additional variables to enable the git-sync feature.
 
In your `main.tf` file, set the `policy_library_sync_enabled` variable in the 
Forseti Terraform module to `"true"` to enable git-sync, and set the 
`policy_library_repository_url` to the URL for your Policy Library repository; 
git protocol is recommended.

```
module "forseti" {
  source                   = "terraform-google-modules/forseti/google"
  project_id               = "PROJECT_ID"
  org_id                   = "ORG_ID"
  domain                   = "DOMAIN"
  
  ...
  
  policy_library_sync_enabled       = "true"
  policy_library_repository_url     = "git@github.com:forseti-security/policy-library"
}
```

(OPTIONAL) `policy_library_sync_ssh_known_hosts`: Provide the [known host keys](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/host-key)
for the git repository. This can be obtained by running ssh-keyscan 
${YOUR_GIT_HOST}.

You should also setup an outputs.tf configuration file for Terraform to obtain the auto-generated public SSH key.

``` 
output "forseti-server-git-public-key-openssh" {
  description = "The public OpenSSH key generated to allow the Forseti Server to clone the policy library repository."
  value       = module.forseti.forseti-server-git-public-key-openssh
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** After applying the Terraform configuration, you will need to add 
the generated SSH key to the git user account. The SSH key will be provided as 
an output from Terraform. If the Policy Library repository is hosted on GitHub, 
you can [follow these steps to add the SSH key to your account](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

To obtain the generated SSH key from Terraform run this command:

```
terraform output forseti-server-git-public-key-openssh
```

You can view any logs related to this process from Stackdriver Logging by 
searching for `git-sync`.
