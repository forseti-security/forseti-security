This quickstart describes how to get started with Forseti Scanner. Forseti
Scanner uses a JSON or YAML rules definition file to audit your Google Cloud
Platform (GCP) resources, such as organizations or projects. After running the
audit, Forseti Scanner outputs rule violations to Cloud SQL and optionally
writes it to Cloud Storage bucket.
