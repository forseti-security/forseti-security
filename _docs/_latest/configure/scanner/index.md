This quickstart describes how to get started with Forseti Scanner. Forseti
Scanner uses a JSON or YAML rules definition file to audit your Google Cloud
Platform (GCP) resources, such as organizations or projects. After running the
audit, Forseti Scanner outputs rule violations to Cloud SQL and optionally
writes it to Cloud Storage bucket.

Forseti Scanner is different from the Cloud Security Scanner, which does App
Engine vulnerability scanning. Learn more about
[Cloud Security Scanner](https://cloud.google.com/security-scanner/).

## Running Forseti Scanner

Forseti Scanner works on a data model, so before you start using Scanner, you'll select a model to use. 

To configure which scanners to run, see 
[Configuring Forseti: Configuring Scanner]({% link _docs/latest/configure/configuring-forseti.md %}#configuring-scanner).


#### Selecting a data model

```bash
$ forseti model use <YOUR_MODEL_NAME>
```

#### Running the scanner

```bash
$ forseti scanner run
```

Scanner produces violations and stores them in the violation table in the database. 
To receive notifications for violations, run the 
[Forseti Notifier]({% link _docs/latest/configure/notifier/index.md %}).
