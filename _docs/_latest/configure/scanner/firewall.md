## Description

Network firewall rules protect your network & organization by only allowing
desired traffic into and out of your network. The firewall rules scanner can
ensure that all your network's firewalls are properly configured.

For examples of how to define scanner rules for your firewall rules scanner, see the
[`firewall_rules.yaml`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/forseti-security/blob/stable/rules/firewall_rules.yaml)
rule file.
