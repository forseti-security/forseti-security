## Before you begin

To complete this guide and enable a service account in your G Suite admin
control panel, you must have the **super admin** role in admin.google.com.

## Enable Domain-wide Delegation (DwD) in G Suite

To enable collection of G Suite data using your existing Forseti
service account, follow the steps below. Read more about
[domain-wide delegation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#delegatingauthority).

### Enable DwD on a service account

1. Go to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console
[Service accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/serviceaccounts){:target="_blank"}
page.

   1. On the right side of the Forseti GCP server service account row,
   under **Options**, click **More > Edit**.

   1. On the **Edit service account** dialog that appears, select the **Enable
   G Suite Domain-wide Delegation** checkbox, then click **Save**.
   NOTE: You may see a field entitled "Product name for the consent screen". You cannot leave this field blank.

**Client ID** value, which will be a large number.

### Enable the service account in your G Suite admin control panel.

1. Go to your Google Admin
[Manage API client access](https://admin.google.com/ManageOauthClients) Security
settings.
1. In the **Client Name** box, paste the **Client ID** you copied above.
1. In the **One or More API Scopes** box, paste the following scope:

    ```
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly
    ```

1. Click **Authorize**.

## Configuring Forseti to collect G Suite data

After you set up your service account above, you may need to edit the
[`domain_super_admin_email`]({% link _docs/v2.8/configure/inventory/index.md %})
field in your `forseti_conf_server.yaml`.

If you are running Forseti on GCP and made any changes to the above values,
you will need to copy the `conf` file to the Cloud Storage bucket. For more
information, see
[Moving configuration to Cloud Storage]({% link _docs/v2.8/configure/general/index.md %}).
