The *rules engine* checks data like Cloud IAM policies and firewall rules against
some user-defined rules. The current version of Forseti Security supports rule checking
for the following resources:

* Organizations
* Folders
* Projects
* Cloud Storage bucket ACLs
* BigQuery dataset ACLs
* Load balancer rules
* Cloud SQL authorized networks

For examples, see the
[rules](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/forseti-security/tree/stable/rules)
directory.

## IamRulesEngine Overview

With the `IamRulesEngine`, Forseti Scanner integrates with Forseti Inventory to
get Cloud IAM policy data for organizations, folders, and projects, and audits the policies
against user-defined rules. `IamRulesEngine` uses the organization resources' hierarchy, so
rules can "roll up" to resource parents. For example, a project under an
organization can look for rules for that project and for its parent
organization.

If a policy binding violates a rule, the `IamRulesEngine` reports a rule violation.
The rule violations can be stored in a CSV, a Cloud Storage bucket, and a Cloud SQL table.

## Creating your own rules engine

The base rules engine class
`google.cloud.security.scanner.audit.BaseRulesEngine` contains some generic
methods for loading rules files in YAML or JSON format. Because Google Cloud
Platform (GCP) resources have different kinds of data that can be checked for
whether they are secureliy configured, you'll need to design the rule checking
based on the kind of data you want to audit.

To design a rules engine, follow the guidelines below:

1. Create another rules engine class that inherits from `BaseRulesEngine`.
1. Implement `BaseRulesEngine.build_rule_book()` and
    `BaseRulesEngine.find_policy_violations()`.
    *   The rule book is a data structure that provides a way to compare a rule
        with a policy.
    *   The `find_policy_violations()` method searches the rule book and
        compares the policy against the rule in the book, if found.
1. Create a new scanner and add the necessary scanner mappings and configurations.
