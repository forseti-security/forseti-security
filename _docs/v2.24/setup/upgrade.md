# {{ page.title }}

This guide explains how to upgrade your Forseti instance.

For version 2.0.0 and later, we will provide upgrade instructions from one minor
version to the next minor version. This means, if you want to upgrade from
version 2.2.0 to 2.4.0, you should follow the upgrade instruction for
version 2.2.0 to 2.3.0 first, and then follow the upgrade instruction for
version 2.3.0 to 2.4.0. This ensures the upgrade process is easier to manage
and to test.

## Upgrade Forseti v2 using deployment manager

If you used the Forseti installer to deploy, the deployment template is in your 
Cloud Storage bucket for the Forseti instance under the `deployment_templates` folder.
The filename will be in the following format: `deploy-forseti-{forseti_instance_type}-{hash}.yaml`,
for example, `deploy-forseti-server-79c4374.yaml`.

### Change deployment properties

1. Review [`deploy-forseti-server.yaml.in`](https://github.com/forseti-security/forseti-security/blob/master-old/deployment-templates/deploy-forseti-server.yaml.in) 
and [`deploy-forseti-client.yaml.in`](https://github.com/forseti-security/forseti-security/blob/master-old/deployment-templates/deploy-forseti-client.yaml.in) 
for any new properties that you need to copy to your previous deployment template. To compare what's changed, use
the `git diff` command. For example, to see the diff between v2.1.0 and v2.2.0, run:

   ```bash
   $ git diff v2.1.0..v2.2.0 -- deployment-templates/deploy-forseti-server.yaml.in
   ```

1. Edit `deploy-forseti-{forseti_instance_type}-{hash}.yaml` and update the field `forseti-version:` under
section `Compute Engine` to the newest tag. For more information, see [the latest release]({% link releases/index.md %}).

### Run the Deployment Manager update

Run the following update command:

```bash
$ gcloud deployment-manager deployments update DEPLOYMENT_NAME \
  --config path/to/deploy-forseti-{forseti_instance_type}-{HASH}.yaml
```

If you changed the properties in the `deploy-forseti-{forseti_instance_type}-{hash}.yaml` `Compute Engine`
section or the startup script in `forseti-instance.py`, you need to reset the instance for changes 
to take effect:

  ```bash
  $ gcloud compute instances reset COMPUTE_ENGINE_INSTANCE_NAME
  ```

The Compute Engine instance will restart and perform a fresh installation of Forseti. You won't 
need to SSH to the instance to run all the git clone or Python install commands.

Some resources can't be updated in a deployment. If an error displays that you can't
change a certain resource, you'll need to create a new deployment of Forseti.

{% capture upgrading_2_13_0_to_2_14_0 %}

You can upgrade from 2.13.0 to 2.14.0 using Deployment Manager or Terraform. 

### Steps to upgrade using Deployment Manager {#dm-upgrade-2-13-0-to-2-14-0}

1. Open cloud shell when you are in the Forseti project on GCP.
1. Checkout forseti with tag v2.14.0 by running the following commands:
    1. If you already have the forseti-security folder under your cloud shell directory,
   run command `rm -rf forseti-security` to delete the folder.
    1. Run command `git clone https://github.com/forseti-security/forseti-security.git` to
   clone the forseti-security directory to cloud shell.
    1. Run command `cd forseti-security` to navigate to the forseti-security directory.
    1. Run command `git checkout tags/v2.14.0` to checkout version `v2.14.0` of Forseti Security.
1. Download the latest copy of your Forseti server deployment template file from the Forseti server GCS
bucket to your cloud shell (located under `forseti-server-xxxxxx/deployment_templates`) by running command 
`gsutil cp gs://YOUR_FORSETI_GCS_BUCKET/deployment_templates/deploy-forseti-server-<LATEST_TEMPLATE>.yaml
deployment-templates/deploy-forseti-server-xxxxx-2-14-0.yaml`.
1. Open up the deployment template `deployment-templates/deploy-forseti-server-xxxxx-2-14-0.yaml` for edit.
  1. Update the `forseti-version` inside the deployment template to `tags/v2.14.0`.
  
1. Upload file `deployment-templates/deploy-forseti-server-xxxxx-2-14-0.yaml` back to the GCS bucket
(`forseti-server-xxxxxx/deployment_templates`) by running command 
`gsutil cp deployment-templates/deploy-forseti-server-xxxxx-2-14-0.yaml gs://YOUR_FORSETI_GCS_BUCKET/

If you see errors while running the deployment manager update command, please refer to below section
`Error while running deployment manager` for details on how to workaround the error.
1. Reset the Forseti server VM instance for changes in startup script to take effect. 
You can reset the VM by running command `gcloud compute instances reset MY_FORSETI_SERVER_INSTANCE --zone MY_FORSETI_SERVER_ZONE` 
Example command: `gcloud compute instances reset forseti-server-vm-70ce82f --zone us-central1-c`

1. Reset the Forseti server VM instance for changes in startup script to take effect. 
You can reset the VM by running command `gcloud compute instances reset MY_FORSETI_SERVER_INSTANCE --zone MY_FORSETI_SERVER_ZONE` 
Example command: `gcloud compute instances reset forseti-server-vm-70ce82f --zone us-central1-c`
1. Repeat step `3-9` for Forseti client.
1. Rule files updates:
   - Update [ke_rules.yaml](https://github.com/forseti-security/forseti-security/blob/release-2.18.0/rules/ke_rules.yaml#L89-L100)
     under `rules/` in your Forseti server GCS bucket to include the latest vulnerable ke versions.

### Steps to upgrade using Terraform {#tf-upgrade-2-17-0-to-2-18-0}

1. Update the `version` inside `main.tf` file to `2.3.0`.
1. Run command `terraform init` to initialize terraform.
1. Run command `terraform plan` to see the infrastructure plan.
1. Run command `terraform apply` to apply the infrastructure build.

### Steps to Upgrade using Terraform
A Cloud Shell walkthrough is provided to assist with upgrading Forseti previously deployed with Terraform.  Completing this guide will also result in a Forseti deployment upgraded to the most recent version.

### Forseti on-GCE
1. Update the `version` inside `main.tf` file to `5.1.4`.

1. Run command `terraform plan` to see the infrastructure plan.
1. Run command `terraform apply` to apply the infrastructure build.

### Forseti on-GKE
1. Update the `version` inside `main.tf` file to `5.1.4`.
2. Run command `terraform init` to initialize terraform.
3. If you previously configured Config Validator in your module by setting the following values:
```
  config_validator_enabled = true
  git_sync_private_ssh_key_file = ""
  policy_library_repository_url = ""
```
You will need to specify an additional value in your `main.tf` to maintain the periodic git-sync feature for the library:
```
  policy_library_sync_enabled   = true
```
4. Run command `terraform plan` to see the infrastructure plan.
5. Run command `terraform apply` to apply the infrastructure build.

If you get the following error while running the deployment manager:
```
The fingerprint of the deployment is .....
Waiting for update [operation-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx]...failed.
ERROR: (gcloud.deployment-manager.deployments.update) Error in Operation [operation-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx]: errors:
- code: NO_METHOD_TO_UPDATE_FIELD
  message: No method found to update field 'networkInterfaces' on resource 'forseti-server-vm-xxxxx'
    of type 'compute.v1.instance'. The resource may need to be recreated with the
    new field.
```

You can follow the following steps to workaround this deployment manager problem:
1. Copy the compute engine section inside your deployment template and paste it to a text editor.
    ```
    # Compute Engine
    - name: forseti-instance-server
      type: forseti-instance-server.py
      properties:
        # GCE instance properties
        image-project: ubuntu-os-cloud
        image-family: ubuntu-1804-lts
        instance-type: n1-standard-2
        ...
        run-frequency: ...
    ```
1. Remove the compute engine section from the deployment template.
1. Run the deployment manager uppdate command on the updated deployment template.  
`gcloud deployment-manager deployments update DEPLOYMENT_NAME --config forseti_server_v2_x_x.yaml`  
This will remove your VM instance.
1. Paste the compute engine section back to the deployment template, and run the update command again.  
`gcloud deployment-manager deployments update DEPLOYMENT_NAME --config forseti_server_v2_x_x.yaml`  
This will recreate the VM with updated fields.
