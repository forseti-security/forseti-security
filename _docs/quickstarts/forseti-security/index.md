This quickstart explains how to use the Forseti setup wizard to get started
quickly with Forseti Security for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) projects.

## Before you begin

To complete this quickstart, you will need:

  - A GCP organization for which you want to deploy Forseti.
  - Org Admin IAM role in order for the script to assign the Forseti 
  service account roles on the _organization_.

## Setting up Forseti Security

The setup wizard presents a series of prompts to guide you through setting
up a Forseti deployment, then generates a deployment template and configuration
file based on your input.

  1. First, download Forseti. The setup wizard is included:
  
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/forseti-security
      ```
      
      If you want to deploy a particular release:
      
      ```
      git checkout <release version>
      ```

  1. Navigate to the setup wizard directory:
  
      ```bash
      cd forseti-security/scripts/gcp_setup
      ```

  1. Start the setup process:
  
      If you downloaded a certain release of Forseti, specify the release version
      to the setup wizard.

      Setup wizard is not available prior to 1.1.0.
      
      _e.g. Deploy 1.1.0:_
      
      ```bash
      python setup_forseti.py --version 1.1.0
      ```
  
     _Default: runs master branch_
     
      ```bash
      python setup_forseti.py
      ```
      
      _Run a certain branch:_
      
      ```bash
      python setup_forseti.py --branch develop
      ```

  1. Follow the prompts to download and install the
  [gcloud command-line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/).
  1. Follow the prompts to authenticate your GCP account in a web browser,
  then return to the command-line.
  1. Enter the organization for which you want to deploy Forseti, if prompted.
  1. Create a new project or enter an existing project ID you want to use for
  Forseti Security. Note that it's best to use a project dedicated to running
  Forseti.
  1. The setup wizard checks for valid configurations or creates a new one,
  then it checks if billing is enabled for your project.
      * If billing isn't enabled, follow the prompts to enable billing, then
    return to the command-line.
  1. Next, the setup wizard automatically enables required APIs:
  
  {% include _global/required_apis.md %}
  
  1. Create a new service account or enter an existing service account for
  accessing GCP.
  1. Optionally create a new service account or enter an existing service
  account for getting GSuite groups.
  1. Next, the setup wizard automatically assigns the required roles to the GCP service
  account. For details about the required roles, see [Forseti Security Best Practices Guide]({% link _docs/guides/best-practices.md %})
  1. Enter a name for your bucket and Cloud SQL instance.
  1. Setup wizard will create a Deployment Manager template based on your input
  as well as ask whether you want to create the deployment.
  1. Optionally create the bucket and a Cloud SQL instance. Only do this if you 
  do not plan to create a deployment via Deployment Manager.
  1. If you set up a service account to retrieve GSuite groups, follow the
  post-setup instructions to enable your GSuite service account for domain-wide delegation.

Forseti Security is now set up for your project and you can enable modules
to use for your resources.
