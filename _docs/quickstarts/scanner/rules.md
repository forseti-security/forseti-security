# {{ page.title }}
This page describes how to define rules for Forseti Scanner.

## Defining custom rules

By default, the DM template includes a rules.yaml file that allows service
accounts on the organization and its children Cloud IAM policies. To define
custom rules, edit your `rules.yaml` and then upload to your `SCANNER_BUCKET`.
The `py/forseti_instance.py` template defaults to `gs://SCANNER_BUCKET/rules`.
If you've stored `rules.yaml` in a different location, make sure to update the
template. You'll need to replace every instance of `rules/rules.yaml` with the
appropriate path.

## Defining Cloud IAM policy rules

Forseti Scanner recognizes the following rule grammar in YAML or JSON:

```yaml
rules:
  - name: $rule_name
    mode: $rule_mode
    resource:
      - type: $resource_type
        applies_to: $applies_to
        resource_ids:
          - $resource_id1
          - $resource_id2
          - ...
    inherit_from_parents: $inherit_from
    bindings:
      - role: $role_name
        members:
          - $member1
          - $member2
          ...
```

-   `rules`: a sequence of rules.
-   `mode`: a string of one of the following values:
    -   `whitelist`: allow the members defined.
    -   `blacklist`: block the members defined
    -   `required`: defined members with the specified roles must be found in
        policy.
-   `resource_type`: a string of one of the following values:
    -   `organization`
    -   `folder` (coming soon)
    -   `project`
-   `applies_to`: a string of one of the following values:
    -   `self`: the rule only applies to the specified resource
    -   `children`: the rule only applies to the child resources of the
        specified resource.
    -   `self_and_children`: the rule applies to the specified resource and its
        child resources.
-   `inherit_from_parents`: a true or false boolean that defines whether a
    specified resource inherits ancestor rules.
-   `role_name`: a
    [Cloud IAM role](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/iam) such as
    `roles/editor` or `roles/viewer`.
    -   You can also use wildcards, such as `roles/*`. Refer to samples or the
        unit tests directory for examples.
-   `members`: a list of Cloud IAM members, such as `username@company.com`. You
    can also use wildcards, such as `serviceAccount:@.gserviceaccount.com` (any
    service accounts).
