## Testing

This page describes how to run tests on your Forseti contributions.

### Executing tests

You can find the unit tests in the top-level `tests/` directory.

To execute tests, run the command below:

`python setup.py google_test --test-dir tests/`

To execute the tests just for a particular module:

`python setup.py google_test --test-dir tests/MODULE_NAME`

To run tests for a particular file pattern:

`python setup.py google_test --test-module-pattern tests`

### Known issues

The unit tests have a lot of errors about gflags. You can ignore these at this
time.
