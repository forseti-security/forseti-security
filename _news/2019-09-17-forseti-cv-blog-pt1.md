author: Adrien Walkowiak

One of the greatest challenges customers face when onboarding in the cloud is how to control 
and protect their assets while letting their users deploy resources securely. 

In this series of four articles, we’ll show you how to start implementing your security 
policies at scale on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) (GCP). The goal is 
to write your security policies as code once and for all, and to apply them both before 
and after you deploy resources in your GCP environment.

In this first post, we’ll discuss two open-source tools that can help you secure your 
infrastructure at scale and scan for non-compliant resources: 
[Forseti](https://github.com/forseti-security/forseti-security) and 
[Config Validator](https://github.com/forseti-security/config-validator).
