# Deploying Forseti Security to Google Cloud

One of the goals of Forseti Security is to provide continuous scanning and enforcement in your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment. [Deployment Manager](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs/) (DM) is a Google Cloud service that helps you automate the deployment and management of your GCP resources. We are using DM to do the following:

* Create a Cloud SQL instance and database for storing Forseti Inventory data.
* Create a Google Compute Engine (GCE) instance for deploying and running Forseti Security.
* Manage configuration for Forseti Security and automatically run the [inventory](../google/cloud/security/inventory/README.md) and [scanner](../google/cloud/security/scanner/README.md) modules.

**Note**: The DM templates currently do not schedule or execute the [enforcer](../google/cloud/security/enforcer/README.md) module.

# Getting started

### Prerequisites
* Install and update `gcloud`. Verify the output of `gcloud info` to determine if your `gcloud` environment is using the right project and username; if not, login and init your environment (see following steps).

```sh
$ gcloud info

  ... some info ...

Account: [user@company.com]
Project: [my-forseti-security-project]

Current Properties:
  [core]
    project: [my-forseti-security-project]
    account: [user@company.com]

  ... more info ...

```

* Create a new project in your Cloud Console.
  * You can also re-use a project that is dedicated for Forseti Security.
  * Enable Billing in your project, if you haven't already.

* Initialize your `gcloud` commandline environment to select your project and auth your Google Cloud account.

```sh
$ gcloud init
```

* Enable **Cloud SQL API**.
```sh
$ gcloud beta service-management enable sql-component.googleapis.com
```
* Enable **Cloud SQL Admin API**.
```sh
$ gcloud beta service-management enable sqladmin.googleapis.com
```
* Enable **Cloud Resource Manager API**.
```sh
$ gcloud beta service-management enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
```

* Enable **Deployment Manager API**.
```sh
$ gcloud beta service-management enable deploymentmanager.googleapis.com
```

### Assign roles to service account
In order to run Forseti Security, you must add a service account to your **organization-level** IAM policy with at least the `Browser` role. This allows Forseti Security to perform operations such as listing the projects within your organization.

**Note**: If you also want to audit/enforce organization IAM policies, you'll need to assign the `Organization Administrator` role. Note that this is a very powerful role; if your GCE instance gets compromised, your entire account could also be compromised!

```sh
$ gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding ORGANIZATION_ID \
  --member=serviceAccount:YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT \
  --role=roles/browser
```

### Using Deployment Templates
The provided DM templates are samples for you to use. Make a copy of `deploy-forseti.yaml.sample` as `deploy-forseti.yaml` and update the following variables:

* CLOUDSQL_INSTANCE_NAME
  * Instance name must be lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens (e.g. "valid-instancename-1", NOT "1_invalid_instanceName.com"); must start with a letter. See [naming guidelines](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/instance-settings#settings-2ndgen) for more information.
  * Instance name must also be unique. If you delete a Cloud SQL instance (either by deleting your deployment or manually through gcloud or the Cloud Console), you cannot reuse that instance name for up to 7 days.
* SCANNER_BUCKET
  * This is just the bucket name; do not include "gs://".
  * The bucket name is subject to the [bucket naming guidelines](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/naming).
  * **Note**: use the same SCANNER_BUCKET name for both the "Cloud Storage" and "Compute Engine" sections in the template.
* YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
  * This can be the application default service account, i.e. `PROJECTNUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`.
  * You must assign the `Browser` role to this service account on the **organization-level** IAM policy.
* YOUR_ORG_ID (the organization id number)
* YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY (the API key for SendGrid email service)
* EMAIL_ADDRESS_OF_YOUR_SENDER (email address of your email sender)
* EMAIL_ADDRESS_OF_YOUR_RECIPIENT (email address of your email recipient)

There are other templates that you can modify if you'd like:

* `py/inventory/cloudsql-instance.py`:  The template for the Google Cloud SQL instance.
* `py/inventory/cloudsql-database.py`: The template for the Google Cloud SQL database.
* `py/storage/bucket.py`: The template for the Google Cloud Storage buckets.
* `py/forseti-instance.py`: The template for the Compute Engine instance where Forseti Security will run.
   * You might want to tweak the startup script (more about [startup scripts in GCP docs](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs/step-by-step-guide/setting-metadata-and-startup-scripts)).
   * By default, the startup script will setup the environment to install the Forseti Security and run the tools every hour.

### Deploying Forseti Security
After you configure the deployment template variables you can create a new deployment.

```sh
$ gcloud deployment-manager deployments create forseti-security \
  --config path/to/deploy-forseti.yaml
```

When your deployment is complete, you can see your deployments in your Cloud Console [Deployment Manager dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/deployments). Also, if you're using the default startup script, Forseti Security should run on the top of the hour and drop a csv in `gs://SCANNER_BUCKET/scanner_violations/`.
