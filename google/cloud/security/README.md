## Installation
### Prerequisites
#### Python version
Forseti Security currently works with Python 2.7.

#### `gcloud` tool
Download and install [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) tool. If you already have
it installed, it's recommended to update it to the latest version.

```sh
$ gcloud components update
```

#### Protobuf compiler (`protoc`)
Download the [protoc pre-built
binary](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases). Forseti Security has been tested with
the protoc 3.0+ (the zip file is named something like
`protoc-VERSION-OS-ARCH.zip`). It's recommended to use an updated version of
protoc (e.g. 3.2.0 fixed a lot of bugs).

Unzip the file and copy the `protoc` binary from the extracted`bin/` directory
to somewhere like /usr/local/bin (or somewhere similar on your path). If `which
protoc` doesn't bring up anything, you may need to change the permissions of the
binary to be executable, i.e. `chmod 755 /path/to/protoc`.

```sh
$ mkdir ~/Downloads/protoc-3.2
$ cd ~/Downloads/protoc-3.2
$ wget https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/download/v3.2.0/protoc-3.2.0-osx-x86_64.zip
$ unzip protoc-3.2.0-osx-x86_64.zip
$ sudo cp bin/protoc /usr/local/bin/protoc
$ sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/protoc
```

#### MySql software
The MySql python connector requires `mysql_config` to be present in your system.

##### Ubuntu
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
```
Note: If libmysqlclient-dev doesn't install mysql_config, then try also installing mysql_server.

##### OS X
The easiest way to do this is with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):
```sh
$ brew install mysql
```

#### pip and virtualenvwrapper (suggested)
##### Ubuntu
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip
$ sudo pip install --upgrade virtualenvwrapper
```

##### OS X
Make sure you have the XCode commandline tools installed. Then install
virtualenvwrapper:

```sh
$ xcode-select --install
$ sudo pip install --upgrade virtualenvwrapper
```
After installing, [run a couple of initialization steps](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
to export the WORKON_HOME env and source the virtualenvwrapper.sh.

#### SendGrid API Key
SendGrid is currently the only supported email service provider. To use it, sign up for a [SendGrid account](https://sendgrid.com) and create a [General API Key](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/api_keys.html). You will use this API key in the deployment templates or as a flag value for the Forseti Security commandline tools.

### Setup
#### Create a virtualenv and activate it, e.g.:
```sh
$ mkvirtualenv forseti-security
$ workon forseti-security
```

### Get the source code
Clone the repo, if you haven't already done so:

#### Run the python setup:

Navigate to your cloned repo, then run:

```sh
$ python setup.py install
```

#### Create a new project for Forseti Security

Create a new GCP project in the [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and set up billing.

**Note**: Forseti Security depends on having a GCP organization set up. Take note of your organization ID, either by looking it up in your Cloud Console IAM settings or asking your Organization Admin. You will need to use it as a flag value when running the individual tools.

#### Create a Service Account
In general, it's highly recommended to create a separate project that contains your service accounts and limited editors/owners. You can then use those service accounts in other projects. For more information, refer to some [best practices](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances#best_practices) for service accounts.

1. Create a custom service account in the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts).
Having a custom service account with only the IAM permissions needed
for testing would allow you to delete the service account when you are done,
and delete the key when it is no longer needed. A custom service
account (separate from your user account) will be less likely to be phished
and easier to clean up than the default service account.
2. Grant the following IAM roles to the service account:
    * Project Editor
    * Cloud SQL Editor 
3. Create and download the json key to your local environment.
4. Set an environment variable to configure the [Application Default Credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials)
to reference this key.
```sh
$ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="<path to your service account key>"
```

## Execution
You should now be able to run the following commandline tools. To see the flag options for each, use
the `--helpshort` or `--helpfull` flags.

 - `forseti_inventory` ([README](/google/cloud/security/inventory/README.md))
 - `forseti_scanner` ([README](/google/cloud/security/scanner/README.md))
 - `forseti_enforcer` ([README](/google/cloud/security/enforcer/README.md))

## Tests
There are unit tests in the `tests/` directory. To execute them, run:

```sh
$ python setup.py google_test --test-dir <test dir>
```

## Forseti Security modules
The Forseti Security modules are developed as modules under `google.cloud.security`.
Each module has its own classes that encapsulate the tool's core functionality.
There are also runner scripts that execute the tool.

### Adding new modules
To add a new module, create it in this directory. Once you have a runner script
that works, create a runner function in the `stubs.py` and plug it into the setup.py
`entry_points['console_scripts']` dictionary.

Re-run `python setup.py install` to install the new console script.
