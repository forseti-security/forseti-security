# Scanner

The Forseti policy scanner takes in a rules definition file (either json or
yaml) and uses it to audit your Google Cloud Platform resources (e.g.
organizations, projects). After running the audit, it outputs a csv file and
optionally writes it to a bucket in Google Cloud Storage.

If you are interested in vulnerability scanning please see [Cloud Security Scanner](https://cloud.google.com/security-scanner/).

## Running the scanner

* Before running the scanner, make sure you've installed the forseti-security
  package and set up your Google Cloud project. Refer to this [README](/google/cloud/security/README.md) for instructions.

* Update gcloud (the following gcloud commands have been tested with version
  1.3.8):

```sh
$ gcloud components update
```

* Set your gcloud environment to use this project. To create a new environment
  configuration:

```sh
$ gcloud init
```

* A sample rules file can be found in the samples/ directory. You should edit
  this to fit your environment.

* To see all the available commandline flags for the scanner, run:

```sh
$ forseti_scanner --helpfull
```

If `forseti_scanner` is not found, you probably need to activate the virtualenv of
your Forseti installation.

To run the scanner with a local rules file:

```sh
$ forseti_scanner --rules path/to/rules.yaml
```

To run the scanner with a rules file stored in GCS, e.g.
`gs://my-project-id/rules/rules.yaml`:

```sh
$ forseti_scanner --rules "rules/rules.yaml" --input_bucket my-project-id
```

To specify the output location for the violations:

```sh
$ forseti_scanner --rules "rules/rules.yaml" --output_path path/for/output/
```

* By default, the scanner will save the csv output to `/tmp`. Specify an output bucket
in order to save the csv there.

* You can also use the convenience [dev_scanner.sh script](/scripts) to run scanner so you don't have to set PYTHONPATH manually.

```sh
$ cd path/to/forseti-security
$ scripts/dev_scanner.sh
```


## Defining rules

Refer to the [documentation](samples/rules.md) on the rules schema.
