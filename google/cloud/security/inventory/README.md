## How to Run
After running setup.py, as long as your virtualenv is activated, then you can be in any directory to invoke the console script:

```sh
$ forseti_inventory
```

You can also use the convenience [dev_inventory.sh script](/scripts) to run forseti_inventory. Make a copy of dev_inventory.sh.sample as dev_inventory.sh, edit the script for the appropriate commandline flags, and invoke the script from the repo root to run inventory.

```sh
$ cd path/to/forseti-security
$ scripts/dev_inventory.sh
```

## How to Test
Look at the test instruction in this [README](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/forseti-security/blob/master/google/cloud/security/README.md#tests).

## Tips & Tricks
* It is helpful to use a mysql GUI tool to inspect the table data.
