# This builds the _docs/latest/ pseudo-directory and updates the inverted index
# for versions to support the version dropdown on docs pages.
#
# 1. The docs are moved over from _docs/_latest/ to _docs/latest
# 2. Tombstone files for docs that existed in a previous version but no longer
#    exist in latest are generated in _docs/latest
# 3. The inverted version index is built
#
# This all done transparently behind-the-scenes such that _docs/latest is only
# seen and used by the Jekyll build process.

# At the start of Jekyll's build process, create a pseudo _docs/latest directory
# to represent the latest/ documentation URLs

# After Jekyll has written the static website to disk at _www/www, then remove
