First, help us help you by providing the following information when opening an issue.

 - [ ] Which version of Forseti Security you're using (look in `/home/ubuntu/forseti-security/google/cloud/forseti/init.py` 
 (on the client).
 - [ ] Which module(s) (inventory, scanner, enforcer, explain) you're having trouble with.
 - [ ] Include errors, log output, and host operating system, including installed packages.
 - [ ] Note how you deployed (via Deployment Manager, Terraform, local system, etc.).

Secondly, if the issue is a feature request, be descriptive regarding what needs to be changed and why, e.g. what to
scan for, what would be a 'good' state and what would be a 'violation' etc.

Finally, be sure to see the [FAQ](https://forsetisecurity.org/docs/latest/faq/) and [Get Help](https://forsetisecurity.org/docs/latest/develop/get-help.html) for assistance.

Thanks!
