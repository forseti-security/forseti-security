# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

* [Contributor License Agreement](#contributor-license-agreement)
* [Style Guideline and Conventions](#style-guideline-and-conventions)
* [How to Submit A Pull Request](#how-to-submit-a-pull-request)

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution,
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Style Guideline and Conventions

In order to maintain consistency, style guidelines as suggested by the
[Google Python Style Guide] should be followed, as well as conforming to
the existing styles in the current codebase.

Style will be checked using pylint. To confirm your PR will pass the
Travis pylint test this must run without any output.

```
$ workon forseti-security # replace forseti-security with your virtalenv.

# Optional
$ pip install pylint

# From the root of forseti-security using pylint >= 1.6.5
$ PYTHONPATH=./ pylint --rcfile=./pylintrc
```

## How to Submit A Pull Request

1. Consult [GitHub Help] for more information on using pull requests.

2. Fork the project, clone your fork to your machine, and configure
the upstream remote.

    ```
    # Fork the project via GitHub UI.

    # Clone your forked repository into local directory.
    $ git clone <url of forked repository>

    # Navigate to your newly cloned directory.
    $ cd <path to you local cloned repository>

    # Assign the original repository to a remote called "upstream".
    # Using HTTPS
    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/forseti-security.git

    # Using SSH
    $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:GoogleCloudPlatform/forseti-security.git

    # Verify new upstream remote is added correctly.
    $ git remote -v

    origin  git@github.com:<my_fork> (fetch)
    origin  git@github.com:<my_fork> (push)
    upstream  git@github.com:GoogleCloudPlatform/forseti-security.git (fetch)
    upstream  git@github.com:GoogleCloudPlatform/forseti-security.git (push)
    ```

3. Fetch the latest changes from upstream into your cloned repository.

    ```
    $ git fetch upstream
    $ git checkout master
    $ git merge upstream/master
    ```

4. Create a new local development branch for your feature or bug fix.

    ```
    $ git checkout -b <my_development_branch>
    ```

5. Create your change.

    A change should be a logical, self-contained unit of work, feature, or fix.
    This way, it is easier for troubleshooting and rollbacks.  In other words,
    please do not incorporate multiple changes in one PR.

    Instructions to execute the tools: [Inventory], [Scanner], [Enforcer]

6. Create your test.

    We strive to have high and useful coverage by unit tests.  If your change
    involves substantial logic, we will request that you write applicable unit
    tests.

    Our unit tests are written with google-apputils basetest framework.
    See a [basic example] of how to use it, in the "Google-Style Tests" section.

    [Instructions to run the tests.]

7. Commit your changes and push them to your development branch.

    ```
    $ git push origin <my_development_branch>
    ```

8. Open a Pull Request to begin the process for code review.

    All submissions, including submissions by project members, require a code review.
    To begin the review process, create a new GitHub pull request. The GitHub UI
    will show if there are any merge conflict(s) to be resolved.

    The GitHub Pull Request UI will show you dropdowns to select the destination of
    your pull request:
    * the base fork is the upstream
    * the head fork is your fork with your changes

    All tests must pass before we will review your PR.
    We also check the codebase with pylint. You can install the git hooks provided
    under scripts/githooks/ to do the check locally.

9. Merging your PR.

    Once your PR is approved and all merge conflicts are resolved, we will merge your PR.
