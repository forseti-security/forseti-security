# This defines the build steps of Forseti docker images. The google container
# builder must be invoked against the root of the git directory.
#
# Example invocation:
#   gcloud container builds submit --config scripts/docker/cloudbuild.yaml ./



steps:
  # Cache base image, ref. https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/speeding-up-builds
  # This step will fail first time a user builds as the base image doesn't exist
  # There is a hack workaround for first time use case
  # ref. https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders/issues/253
  # but for now let user comment this out if needed.
