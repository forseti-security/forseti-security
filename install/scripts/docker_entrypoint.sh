# Usage
# (sudo if needed) docker exec ${CONTAINER_ID} /forseti-security/install/scripts/docker_entrypoint.sh ${BUCKET}

# UNDER DEVELOPMENT. For now basic functionality, just starts Forseti Server.
# This script serves as the entrypoint for starting Forseti server in a Docker container.
# Ref. https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint
#
# This script assumes it's running in a container on a GCE Container Optimized OS VM
# that is already authorized with the forseti service account.

# TODO remove set -x after debugging complete
# set -x enables a mode of the shell where all executed commands are printed to the terminal.
# With this  enabled, we should not put anything private/secret in the commands called because
# they will be logged.

# TODO named arg and arg validation
# TODO arg to control which services to start (default to server for now)
