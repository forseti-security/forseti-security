# This script serves as the entrypoint for starting Forseti server in a Docker container.
# Ref. https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint
#
# This script assumes it's running in a container on a GCE Container Optimized OS VM
# that is already authorized with the forseti service account.
# gsutil will automatically use the hosting VM's service account.
# TODO Other scenarios.

# TODO named arg and arg validation
# TODO arg to control which services to start (default to server for now)
BUCKET=$1

# Download config files
gsutil cp ${BUCKET}/configs/forseti_conf_server.yaml /forseti-security/configs/forseti_conf_server.yaml
